            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: This website fails on the contrast aspect by mixing all the text together in one big red mess, dark red on black backround to be specific. This makesalmost all text on the webpage unreadable unless you put your face straight up against the screen. </li>
                <li>Repition: While the site may decive some into thinking the over use of dark red is repition its only in name and doesnt create unity. Espesally in the junior jam tab of the site many fonts and colors are used turning the page into an element soup, nothing comes together. Side note the links in the games tab in junior jam are coloerd purple >=(</li>
                <li>Alignment: While the site fails in most of the design aspects the alignment on elements on the page (not counting the main one) are solid. Every tab had a tiltle on top with a picture below that and some text below that and lastly the links at the bottom for policies.</li>
                <li>Proximity: Proximity is alo a principle not seen discarded unlike the first two. The elements while hard to see are still grouped in a way to convery that they belong together. The policy links at the bottom of each tab are close together, the link to games and the paragraph text are together, and lastly the links embedded into the pictures are together.</li>
