            <ul>
                <li><Strong>Contrast:</Strong> This website fails on the contrast aspect by mixing all the text together in one big red mess, dark red on black backround to be specific. This makesalmost all text on the webpage unreadable unless you put your face straight up against the screen. </li>
                <li><Strong>Repition:</Strong> While the site may decive some into thinking the over use of dark red is repition its only in name and doesnt create unity. Espesally in the junior jam tab of the site many fonts and colors are used turning the page into an element soup, nothing comes together. Side note the links in the games tab in junior jam are coloerd purple >=(</li>
                <li><Strong>Alignment:</Strong> While the site fails in most of the design aspects the alignment on elements on the page (not counting the main one) are solid. Every tab had a tiltle on top with a picture below that and some text below that and lastly the links at the bottom for policies.</li>
                <li><Strong>Proximity:</Strong> Proximity is alo a principle not seen discarded unlike the first two. The elements while hard to see are still grouped in a way to convery that they belong together. The policy links at the bottom of each tab are close together, the link to games and the paragraph text are together, and lastly the links embedded into the pictures are together.</li>

            <h3>Website title: <a href="https://www.sixflags.com/carowinds" target="_blank">Sixflags - Carowinds</a> Design Analysis: Great <br>Crap Evaluations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><Strong>Contrast:</Strong> This landing page for the carowinds theme park does an excellent job of contrasting text on the page. The main background is white and the text is a very dark blue allowing for easy reading, in spots where pictures are dominant white text is used. </li>
                <li><Strong>Repition:</Strong> This websits main color and UI design is simple but excellent, its use up and down the pages creates a repition that really brings everything together. Espesally in the diffrent tabs / links in the webpage that travel to lists of elements that repeat the same big title, small paragraph text, and picture. </li>
                <li><Strong>Alignment:</Strong> On the front page clickable elements are aligned not only vertically but also horizontally. It gives the page a professional and connected feeling, while there is white space it doesn't feel like too much empty space and everything is in scrolls reach.</li>
                <li><Strong>Proximity:</Strong> Every clickable element has a small title, description, and picture all close together keeping related info together. This allows for anyone viewing the page to get a small sample of related information before clicking.</li>
