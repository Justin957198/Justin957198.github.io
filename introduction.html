        <p>I am a junior attending here at UNCC. I'm a computer science major with a concentration in Web/App development. I’m excited to learn how to put a face on the backends and servers I'm in progress of making.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Academic Background: </h3>
                I am currently a junior attending UNCC with a major in computer science with a concentration in Web/App development. I transferred here after getting my associates degree from CPCC.</li>
            <li><h3>Background in Subject: </h3>
                While i dont have much experience in front end languages, I've spent the last year rapidly learning java with a bit of Python in my various classes. I’ve also been working on a few basic beginner projects on my github albeit most of them are private.</li>
            <li><h3>Primary Work Computer: </h3>
                My primary work computer is my ASUS Vivobook laptop I bring with me to school and anywhere else I will be staying for a while.</li>
            <li><h3>Backup Work Computer & Location Plan: </h3>
                My back up computer would be a custom built water cooled rig I have at home which has most of the same required programs needed for classwork.</li>
            <li><h3>Courses I’m taking and why: </h3>
                Here are some reasons why I'm taking them.
            <ol>
                <li>This class is for learning how to make professional / human friendly front ends.</li>
                <li>ITSC 3160 Database Design and Implementation - To solidify my knowledge on databases and utilize them better.</li>
                <li>ITIS 3130 Introduction to Human Centered Computing - To create programs that are usable by all and understand how users interact with them.</li>
                <li>STAT 2122 Intro to Probability and Statistics - Required</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li>I’d also like to share: I’ve successfully built and maintained two computers.</li>
        </ul>
